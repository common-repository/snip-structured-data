SNIP helps you to create Rich Snippets and Rich Search Results by using Structured Data readable by search engines.

== Description ==

### SNIP - Structured Data Plugin for WordPress to create Rich Snippets and Rich Search Results

Since 2012, SNIP Structured Data has helped thousands of websites worldwide to **display eye-catching search results on Google** and other search engines. This gave them better visibility in search engines.

Eye-catching search results, you ask? How is that possible? It's because of little snippets of code (called Structured Data) that **tell search engines exactly what kind of content they'll find on your site.** This way, they can better understand that content. Certain Structured Data snippets are displayed on search results pages as **Rich Search results**, a different way of displaying your content on the search engine results page (SERP).

The free version allows you to add structured data to all your pages, posts or custom post types with the world's first Structured Data Generator. So it contains everything you need to get started quickly on a standard WordPress site.

#### My story and mission

I originally developed SNIP for my own purposes. After a few months I decided to make it available to the public. After years on the market, there is finally a free version of SNIP.

My mission is to provide a high performance, easy to use and powerful plugin to **bring structured data (which is part of technical SEO) to any WordPress site without having knowledge about the technical details of coding.** SNIP's users range from recipe, travel, WooCommerce stores to many other custom sites.

#### Get ahead of the competition
Do you do SEO on your website? Of course you do! Because you need to **beat the competition.** Structured data is technical SEO and can help you get eye-catching search results on Google and other search engines. Obviously, **good looking search results** get more clicks! SNIP uses the schema.org vocabulary to create schemas that can **generate so-called Rich Snippets or Rich Results** in search engines. You'll see these as star ratings, price quotes, bullet points, images, and more on search results pages.

#### Taking care of your Structured Data on your WordPress site

SNIP Structured Data is packed with features designed to help visitors and search engines get a deep understanding of your site's content. Some of my favorites features are:

*   The world's first **Structured Data Generator**.
*   Supports 30+ Schemas in the free version.
*   Supports **all schema.org schemas** (currently 800+) **[PRO]**.
*   **Automate schema creation** with the built-in Global Snippets feature (create a schema template and play it out to any page, post or custom post type).
*   Supports 10+ field types for use in schema templates.
*   Supports 30+ field types for use in schema templates **[PRO]**.
*   Remove old and invalid schema syntax from your WordPress site.
*   Compatible with almost all themes.
*   Override schema properties on a per-post basis **[PRO]**.
*   Retrieve post metadata (e.g. from Advanced Custom Fields) **[PRO]**.
*   Completely free Structured Data video course!
*   Premium support from the plugin author **[PRO]**.
*   Made in Germany!

#### Trust the expert

I'm Florian (Flo for short), a freelance web developer who has been doing general web development for over 17 years. And as you might expect: I'm really passionate about what I do (who else can really claim that?). Hopefully you can feel my passion in the brand new SNIP plugin now available on wordpress.org. ðŸ™‚

### What users of the PRO version say

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by MChav06 via CodeCanyon:
> This is the first schema plugin that allows absolute control on a post-by-post basis. Support is excellent, and Florian is always open to new ideas to implement to make the plugin even better. Definitely worth every penny and then some.

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by vacuumsrus via CodeCanyon:
> Dude seriously this plugin is worth three times what I paid for it. I tried two other plugins before this and looked over several others. Your plugin does EVERY THING all the other ones do all in one plugin. And slick too. (...) THANK YOU!

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by Patrick_D via CodeCanyon:
> Flo is just plain out awesome ðŸ™‚ Even when bouncing ideas around with him you can see that he never loses focus.

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by jjsolutions via CodeCanyon
> At last I've found something that takes the stress out of creating structured data. Previously I've tried myself and there is always one tag out of place and it's been impossible to get everything to pass the Google Structured Testing Tool but this plugin took the pain away.

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by ecoman via CodeCanyon
> Perfect tool for structured data. And "Made in Germany" :-)

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by mjankowski via CodeCanyon
> I tried a few Rich Snippets plugins but they were all too complicated or simply didn't work. Thanks to SNIP I have finally figured it out and now my website looks much better in Google search results. Strongly recommend!

â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… by Azraph via CodeCanyon
> It was hard to choose for which reason this plugin is the best rich snippet plugin available, it's super customizable, the documentation is just amazingly extensive, not to mention the awsome video crash course on structured data that's freely available on the author's site, the customer support was, in my experience, one of the best support you could wish for. The overall quality of the product is top-notch, everything just works as it's supposed to. Finally, this plugin is so flexible it will fit whatever your needs/setup is, you can automate and retrieve data from any field in posts_meta and even the wp_options table which practically covers any plugin and/or custom fields situation.

### Get premium support

I offer regular support on the WordPress.org forums. But I hope you understand that I have to give priority to my premium customers. This one-to-one email support is available for people who have purchased the Pro version of the plugin.

Special note for version 2.0.0 on wordpress.org:
